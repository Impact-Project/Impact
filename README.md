# Impact
This is impact's official ui source use or taking partial code requires to credit us and link it to the source.

This release was from 2018 it's very outdated and instable, I recommend to use it for learning not building.

Many of you may ask why I released it I did this to help out the new and inexperienced under us to learn more, This was coded with a lot of thoughts going into it I put at least a few weeks into it, This is still very outdated though and some stuff could not be working properly.

Cheers, Void
